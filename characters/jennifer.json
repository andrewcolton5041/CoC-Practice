  "backstory": "Jennifer heralds from an English family, whose wealth was accumulated during the early 19th century though shipping ventures. Her parents were lost at sea in 1888 while on board the SS Vaitarna on route to Bombay, leaving Jennifer and her older sister Valerie the heirs to the Smallwood fortune. While Valerie preferred to remain at the family's home in Hampshire, Jennifer packed her bags and elected to travel to the New World. The decision strained her relationship with her sister, who considered a lady's job was to find a suitable husband and not go gallivanting to foreign climes.",
