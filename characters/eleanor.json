When faced with the prospect of marrying a local boy, she resolved to escape the future that destiny had in store for her and ran away, jumping a train to New York. Working what jobs she could find, she still found time for her favorite pastime, reading history books in the New York Public Library; a lifelong passion that drove her into getting an education and becoming a historian. In academic life, she has yet to make a mark, a fact that often plays upon her mind, as she sees others finding renown while her work goes unrecognized.",
